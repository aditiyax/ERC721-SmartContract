# ERC721 Smart Contract

This project implements an ERC721 compliant smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed for creating and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ensuring unique and secure digital assets.

## Features

- **ERC721 Standard**: Fully compliant with the ERC721 standard for NFTs.
- **Unique Tokens**: Each token is unique and cannot be duplicated.
- **Ownership Tracking**: Securely tracks ownership and transfers of tokens.
- **Metadata Support**: Supports metadata for each token, enhancing usability.

## Project Overview

The ERC721 Smart Contract is written in Solidity and can be deployed on any Ethereum-compatible blockchain. It provides all the standard functionalities of the ERC721 standard, including minting, transferring, and querying tokens. The contract also supports metadata extension, allowing each token to have associated metadata such as images, names, and descriptions.

## Usage

To use the ERC721 Smart Contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet and some Ether to deploy the contract and interact with it. The contract can be deployed using tools like Truffle or Remix, and interactions can be performed through a web3 interface or directly from the Ethereum console.
